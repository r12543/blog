Oooooh-weeee, my first blog post!

First post is a major key to success.

The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they donâ€™t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.

 <pre><code>npm install beer --save --in-mouth</code></pre>
